This demonstrates a Software Development Consultant scenario where agents remember:
- Client project requirements and preferences
- Technical decisions and architecture choices
- Past recommendations and implementation details

Requirements:
- pip install memorisdk autogen-agentchat "autogen-ext[openai]" python-dotenv
- Set OPENAI_API_KEY in environment or .env file

Usage:
